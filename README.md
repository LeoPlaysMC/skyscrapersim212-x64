# skyscrapersim212-x64
This is an altered version of Skyscraper 2.11 Alpha. The software was originally created by Ryan Thoryk as a school project.
It was created using C++ code language along with the OGRE Graphics Engine.
The use of this software is to test and simulate elevators and escalators by riding them in a 3D environment.
**Unfortunately, my version is only 64-bit as computer's these days are only 64-bit dependant. I might release a 32-bit version in the future but don't count on it.**
